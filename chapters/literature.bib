@article{ChenERM,
 abstract = {A data model, called the entity-relationship model, is proposed. This model incorporates some of the important semantic information about the real world. A special diagrammatic technique is introduced as a tool for database design. An example of database design and description using the model and the diagrammatic technique is given. Some implications for data integrity, information retrieval, and data manipulation are discussed.The entity-relationship model can be used as a basis for unification of different views of data: the network model, the relational model, and the entity set model. Semantic ambiguities in these models are analyzed. Possible ways to derive their views of data from the entity-relationship model are presented.},

@article{CICDDebate1,
 abstract = {Throughout its short history, software development has been characterized by harmful disconnects between important activities such as planning, development and implementation. The problem is further exacerbated by the episodic and infrequent performance of activities such as planning, testing, integration and releases. Several emerging phenomena reflect attempts to address these problems. For example, Continuous Integration is a practice which has emerged to eliminate discontinuities between development and deployment. In a similar vein, the recent emphasis on DevOps recognizes that the integration between software development and its operational deployment needs to be a continuous one. We argue a similar continuity is required between business strategy and development, BizDev being the term we coin for this. These disconnects are even more problematic given the need for reliability and resilience in the complex and data-intensive systems being developed today. We identify a number of continuous activities which together we label as `Continuous~*' (i.e. Continuous Star) which we present as part of an overall roadmap for Continuous Software engineering. We argue for a continuous (but not necessarily rapid) software engineering delivery pipeline. We conclude the paper with a research agenda.},

This study is meant to give an overview of what DevSecOps is, what implementing DevSecOps means, the benefits gained from DevSecOps and the challenges an organization faces when doing so. To that end, we conducted a multivocal literature review, where we reviewed a selection of grey literature. We found that implementing security that can keep up with DevOps is a challenge, but it can gain great benefits if done correctly.},

@misc{SQLvsNOSQLPerformance,
 abstract = {With the current emphasis on ``Big Data'', NoSQL databases have surged in popularity. These databases are claimed to perform better than SQL databases. In this paper we aim to independently investigate the performance of some NoSQL and SQL databases in the light of key-value stores. We compare read, write, delete, and instantiate operations on key-value stores implemented by NoSQL and SQL databases. Besides, we also investigate an additional operation: iterating through all keys. An abstract key-value pair framework supporting these basic operations is designed and implemented using all the databases tested. Experimental results measure the timing of these operations and we summarize our findings of how the databases stack up against each other. Our results show that not all NoSQL databases perform better than SQL databases. Some are much worse. And for each database, the performance varies with each operation. Some are slow to instantiate, but fast to read, write, and delete. Others are fast to instantiate but slow on the other operations. And there is little correlation between performance and the data model each database uses.},
