@article{CICDDebate1,
 abstract = {Throughout its short history, software development has been characterized by harmful disconnects between important activities such as planning, development and implementation. The problem is further exacerbated by the episodic and infrequent performance of activities such as planning, testing, integration and releases. Several emerging phenomena reflect attempts to address these problems. For example, Continuous Integration is a practice which has emerged to eliminate discontinuities between development and deployment. In a similar vein, the recent emphasis on DevOps recognizes that the integration between software development and its operational deployment needs to be a continuous one. We argue a similar continuity is required between business strategy and development, BizDev being the term we coin for this. These disconnects are even more problematic given the need for reliability and resilience in the complex and data-intensive systems being developed today. We identify a number of continuous activities which together we label as `Continuous~*' (i.e. Continuous Star) which we present as part of an overall roadmap for Continuous Software engineering. We argue for a continuous (but not necessarily rapid) software engineering delivery pipeline. We conclude the paper with a research agenda.},

 abstract = {Involving security in DevOps has been a challenge because traditional security methods have been unable to keep up with DevOps' agility and speed. DevSecOps is the movement that works on developing and integrating modernized security methods that can keep up with DevOps. This study is meant to give an overview of what DevSecOps is, what implementing DevSecOps means, the benefits gained from DevSecOps and the challenges an organization faces when doing so. To that end, we conducted a multivocal literature review, where we reviewed a selection of grey literature. We found that implementing security that can keep up with DevOps is a challenge, but it can gain great benefits if done correctly.},
