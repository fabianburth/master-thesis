%Ich versichere, dass ich diese Masterthesis selbständig angefertigt, nicht anderweitig für Prüfungszwecke vorgelegt, alle benutzten Quellen und Hilfsmittel angegeben, sowie wörtliche und sinngemäße Zitate gekennzeichnet habe.\\
I declare that I have composed the master thesis myself and without use of any other than the cited sources and aids. Sentences or parts of sentences quoted literally are marked as such; other references with regard to the statement and scope are indicated by full details of the publications concerned. The thesis in the same or similar form has not been submitted to any examination body and has not been published. This thesis was not yet, even in part, used in another examination or as a course performance. Furthermore I declare that the submitted written (bound) copies of the master thesis and the version submitted in digital format are consistent with each other in contents.\\
